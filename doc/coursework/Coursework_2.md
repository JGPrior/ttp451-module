## Coursework Assignment 2: Planning experiments (25%)

In an investigation of a new gasoline engine, there are several new systems to be proven and understood and finally calibrated.

The combustion system is DI spark ignition, and the engine is boosted in two stages in series – a low pressure electrically powered fan and a conventional turbocharger with VGT control. The engine is equipped with VVA on both inlet and exhaust allowing retard of IVC (for fuel efficiency), control of overlap at full load and advance of EVO to manage the energy flow to the turbocharger and to manage the exhaust temperature.

The “after-treatment” system is a lean NOx trap (LNT) which requires regeneration in the normal way.  The investigation will encompass control strategies to reduce the volume of the LNT by ensuring accurate control of exhaust temperature.

Write a short report describing and explaining an experimental strategy that includes:

- Management of valve timing
- Control of boost pressure
- Temperature management with the VVA and turbocharger systems working together
- Management of LNT regeneration conditions.

Start the report with a description of the overall control strategy.  Using diagrams show the actuators and sensors and as you explain the experimental strategy, identify factors (usually controls or calibratable parameters) and response variables (usually quantities that we want to minimise).

Pay particular attention to the overall structure of the experimental approach. Do you need global and local models for example?  What do you know in advance that will guide the choice of strategy?  You may start with a space filling design and move into classical to develop response surfaces, but what response surfaces do you need?  What is the place of optimal methods, to refine relationships as you try to confirm the values of calibratable parameters?

You should address the report to a team leader whose job it is to scope the experimental programme. The report should be no more than 3 pages in length.
